# Example GitHub Repository
## Summary
This repository was created to demonstrate Git and GitHub to WBS students. Branching, pull requests, and merge conflicts are all demonstrated for a richer image of the platform's possibilties.
## Languages and Libraries Used
Python
## Key Learnings
While initial exposure to Git can be daunting, students who continue to use Git and GitHub throughout the bootcamp become comfortable and confident with it by the end. It is a helpful tool for any colaborative project, but even more important for job-seeking students is the ability to create a public porfolio that can be provided to potential employers.
## Challenges Overcame
Finding the right way to demonstrate Git without overwhelming students can be difficult. This project is under continual revision when alternative methods of demonstration are ideated. 
## Additional Reflections
While the concept of branching and merging is fairly straightforward, putting it in words is surprisingly difficult.
